This is a barebones Gatsby starter for Netlify CMS. It's based on the Gatsby Hello World starter, with elements of the Netlify CMS Gatsby starter. 

It has just enough templates and packages to get a site off the ground and working, but no styling whatsoever.

To add more static pages or collections, edit the config.yml in the admin/static directory.
